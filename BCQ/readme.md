.card-col .card-design -> is it possible to have two block class in one div?
To make a div center of the page is it good practice to use the transform: translate with postion abosolute?

Ifwe have .main and .score-main two classes in one main div so .main is common for all the pages whereas .score-main has specifice custom styles for its pages so do we need to extend the .main properties in .score-main?

.main 
    element .main__element
If we start direct with element then there will be any problem.
